# Nanostream

Nanostream is a minimalist, creator-agnostic video streaming platform created with React / Redux. It currently runs only on a local RTMP server as we search for a better backend solution for remote video streaming support. Stay tuned! 

Here's a demo of how it works locally in the meantime: https://youtu.be/9spVrYz_Pd4
